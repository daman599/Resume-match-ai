       You are an intelligent job-matching assistant.

       I will provide you with:
       1. A candidate's resume as plain text.
       2. A list of job openings, each as an object in a JSON array.

       ### Your task:
       Analyze the resume to understand the candidate's:
       - Skills
       - Experience
       - Education
       - Job roles they are suited for

       Then evaluate each job in the list to determine if it matches the candidate’s profile.

       ### Output format:
       Return ONLY the job objects from the list that are **relevant and well-suited** for the candidate.
       Do not include any explanation or additional text.
       Respond in **strict JSON format** — an array of matching job objects.

       ---

       ### Candidate Resume:
       ${resumeText}

       ---

       ### Job Listings:
       ${JSON.stringify(latest_jobs)}

       ---

       Now, return only the matching jobs in a clean JSON array.
